# Training Your DataSet with CNN
This project is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model designed for emotion classification. By training the model, it tries to determine whether people are happy or unhappy from the expressions on their faces.


## Make an Algorithm

 🟩 Image DataSet Creation
-Three separate files were created: Training, Test, Verification

It consists of 20 photographs, including 10 happy and 10 unhappy photographs.Inside each file are the same images.

🟩 CNN Model Creation

🟩 Model Training

🟩 Model Evaluation

🟩 Forecasting
